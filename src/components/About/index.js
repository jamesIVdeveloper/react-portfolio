      <p>
        Front-end web developer with experience in back-end. Currently finishing
        up a full-stack program through Vanderbilt University, where I am
        acquiring skills such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, ORM, MVC,
        React, as well as others. With each project, I focus on creating great
        functionality, as well as an aesthetic user experience that is easy to
        navigate. In a recent project, I worked with two other developers to
        create a full-stack movie review application called ‘It Was the 90’s’. I
        took a lead role in the project, building several components and
        connecting back-end to front-end, as well as working out several bugs
        that arose. It was a great experience, and I look forward to building on
        what I learned to continue to create bigger and better applications with
        other developers.
